import Source from '../../components/Source.astro'

Hi everyone. My name is Adam and welcome to the *unofficial* start of my passion project. It's unofficial because today is actually the day before the start.

That is also why I don't want to actually start researching yet. I just want to set some things up so that they are ready to go tomorrow when I actually plan on starting.
Here is the list of the things that I want to do today:

- Setting up the blog
- Create a `<Source />` component
- Create a timeline with a planning and blog-posts
- Making a planning

I had already set up a default *Astro* blog a few weeks ago, but today I want to implement some things that would make the blog a bit more interesting and my life a bit easier.

Recently I have setup my **Astro** projects in similar ways, by adding **Typescript**, **React** and **Tailwind**. This time around, I am doing the same, although I am not using *React*, since this blog is purely static and making it client-side rendered is not necessary.

I had this idea of adding a component to easily add my sources to the blog. I start out by defining a `<Source />` component that takes a `year`, `link`, `APA` and `name` prop. It shows the name and year formatted like this `name (year)`. The `APA` prop is a string that is the APA citation of the source. The `link` prop is a string that is the link to the source.
I checked if it was possible to generate the APA style with javascript, and I am sure there is some type of library for it, but I can't be bothered right now and I'll just do it manually.

To finish up this Source component, I am adding a small script to the `<body />` that makes the APA reference visible whenever you hover over the source. 

```tsx
    import { gsap } from "gsap";

    const sources = document.getElementsByClassName("source");

    let selectedSource: Element | null = null;

    for (const source of sources) {
    source.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => {
        source.classList.add("hover");
        selectedSource = source;
    });

    source.addEventListener("mouseleave", () => {
        source.classList.remove("hover");
        selectedSource = null;
    });
    }

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
    if (selectedSource) {
        const apa = selectedSource.children[1];
        gsap.to(apa, {
        x: e.clientX - selectedSource.getBoundingClientRect().left + 40,
        y: e.clientY - selectedSource.getBoundingClientRect().top - 20,
        duration: 0.5,
        overwrite: "auto",
        });
    }
    });
```

The result looks as followed: <Source year={2024} link='https://doi.org/10.20396/conce.v13i00.8678230' APA='Rosa, P. (2024). Archiving social movement(s). Conceição|Conception, 13, e024013. https://doi.org/10.20396/conce.v13i00.8678230' name='Rosa' /> (hover over it to see the APA reference.)
 

With that done, I can move on to visualising my posts. I want to do it as a sort of timeline where you can see the days that I worked and simultaneously see what I had planned to do by this day. I am going to implement this by having a second source of what *Astro* calls **content**.

Basically, I can just make *Markdown* files in a *Planning* folder, list what I want to do by a certain date, and my code will neatly display both these plans and the actual posts in a nice side-scrolling timeline.

It's getting quite late, so I am going to make a plan for *just* tomorrow and finish up for today. Then tomorrow, I can make the actual plan for the whole project.
