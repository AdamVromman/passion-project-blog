I was just on the train to Kortrijk, and in the 4 years of Devine that has always been where I had the best ideas. I can just sit still for 30 minutes, looking out the window and something will reveal itself to me.

In a flash, I saw the whole website in front of me. I was avoiding thinking of it as a dashboard, because I though that would force me to use more traditional data visualisation, but as i was staring out of the window, I realised that I could do a sort of dashboard but have the visualisation be a combination of all the ideas that I had.

The idea is that the header is an eye that shows different statistics for a single day. If people died, were wounded, etc.

Under that I would do a timeline of the whole history between Israel and Palestina, starting in 1917. Visitors would be able to drag certain icon's on the timeline to see how these things evolved over time.

Lastly, the rest of the website would be filled with the *Keffiyeh* pattern, made up of data, somehow. That part is still the most vague.
All this would also allow me to use certain techonologies with certain parts of the website.

Okay, so I start out by getting the relevant data from [this source](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/casualties-daily/), who's source is the ministry of health of Palestina. I fetch the url and if the site returns a *200 OK status*, I save the data in a *React State*.

```tsx
const [data, setData] = useState<any[] | null>(null);

const getData = async () => {
    let data = await fetch(
      "https://data.techforpalestine.org/api/v2/casualties_daily.json"
    ).then(async (response) => {
      if (response.ok) {
        return await response.json();
      }
    });
    setData(data);
  };
```

This returns an Array of days, with stats for each day, for example:

```json
{
    "report_date": "2025-01-19",
    "report_source": "mohtel",
    "report_period": 24,
    "ext_massacres_cum": 4034,
    "killed": 14,
    "killed_cum": 46913,
    "ext_killed": 14,
    "ext_killed_cum": 46913,
    "ext_killed_children_cum": 17841,
    "ext_killed_women_cum": 12298,
    "injured": 25,
    "injured_cum": 110750,
    "ext_injured": 25,
    "ext_injured_cum": 110750,
    "ext_civdef_killed_cum": 94,
    "ext_med_killed_cum": 1068,
    "ext_press_killed_cum": 204
  }
```

Next, I wrote a function that returns a specific day,

```tsx
const [day, setDay] = useState<any | null>(null);

const setSingleDay = (date: Date) => {
    if (data) {
      const days = data.filter((d: any) => {
        return new Date(d.report_date).getTime() === date.getTime();
      });

      if (days) {
        const day = days[0];
        setDay(day);
        console.log(day);
        return day;
      }
    }
  };
```
 and then I added both the people killed and injured on that day to a single array, which is then used to generate the eye.

 ```tsx
 const localDay = setSingleDay(new Date(2025, 0, 1, 1, 0));

      if (localDay) {
        const killed = new Array(localDay.killed).fill(0);
        const injured = new Array(localDay.injured).fill(1);
        const array = killed.concat(injured);
        shuffleArray(array);

        d3.select(svg.current).selectAll("rect").remove();

        d3.select(svg.current)
          .selectAll("rect")
          .data(array)
          .enter()
          .append("rect")
          .style("transform-origin", `center 192px`)
          .attr("width", 20)
          .attr("height", (_) => 100 + (Math.random() * 10 - 5))
          .attr("x", svg.current?.clientWidth / 2 - 10)
          .attr("y", svg.current?.clientHeight / 2 + 50)
          .attr(
            "transform",
            (_, i) =>
              `rotate(${(360 / array.length) * i + (-10 + Math.random() * 20)})`
          )
          .attr("fill", (type) => (type === 0 ? "red" : "black"));
      }
```

<Demo title='Eye tests' type='GSAP'>
<DemoEye client:only="react" />

Okay, This is a good start. To not lose this code if I end up changing a lot, I am going to create a new demo and try some different things.

<DemoEye2 client:only="react" />
</Demo>

In the second demo, I tried to aggragate data each week, because I thought this would make it more clear and it would make the data a bit more reliable. But it ends up being quite heavy for the browser, since there are weeks where the number of people killed exceeds 1500 people, wich translates to 1500 moving elements on the screen. I am therefor thinking of going back to daily data, which also spares me a lot of date calculations.

<Demo title='Eye test per day' type='GSAP'>
<DemoEye3 client:only="react" />
</Demo>

Although this is working better, if you scroll through the days, you can tell that there is something wrong with the data. Most days it seems that the only victims were men, and some days it's only men and women. I don't feel like this is usable at this moment. 

Right now, I calculate the data in the following way:

```tsx
const getData = async (day: Date) => {
    await fetch(
      "https://data.techforpalestine.org/api/v2/casualties_daily.json"
    ).then(async (response) => {
      if (response.ok) {
        let previousDay: any;
        await response.json().then((data: any[]) => {
          const date1 = data.find((d: any, i: number, data: any[]) => {
            const date = new Date(d.report_date);
            if (date.getTime() === day.getTime())
              previousDay = data[i - 1] ?? null;
            return date.getTime() === day.getTime();
          });

          if (
            date1 &&
            previousDay &&
            date1.report_source === previousDay.report_source
          ) {
            const childrenKilled =
              date1.ext_killed_children_cum -
              previousDay.ext_killed_children_cum;
            const womenKilled =
              date1.ext_killed_women_cum - previousDay.ext_killed_women_cum;
            const emergencyServiceMembersKilled =
              date1.ext_civdef_killed_cum - previousDay.ext_civdef_killed_cum;
            const medicalPersonnelKilled =
              date1.ext_med_killed_cum - previousDay.ext_med_killed_cum;

            const pressKilled =
              date1.ext_press_killed_cum - previousDay.ext_press_killed_cum;

            let menKilled =
              date1.ext_killed_cum -
              previousDay.ext_killed_cum -
              womenKilled -
              childrenKilled -
              emergencyServiceMembersKilled -
              medicalPersonnelKilled -
              pressKilled;

            if (menKilled < 0) {
              menKilled =
                date1.killed -
                womenKilled -
                childrenKilled -
                emergencyServiceMembersKilled -
                medicalPersonnelKilled -
                pressKilled;
            }

            if (menKilled < 0) {
              menKilled = 0;
            }

            setWomenKilled(womenKilled);
            setChildrenKilled(childrenKilled);
            setMenKilled(menKilled);
            setEmergencyServiceMembersKilled(emergencyServiceMembersKilled);
            setMedicalPersonnelKilled(medicalPersonnelKilled);
            setPressKilled(pressKilled);
          }
        });
      }
    });
  };
```
If I want to know how many press was killed on a certain day, I take the total amount of press killed up until that day and subtract the total amount on the previous day. This seems to have a mayor flaw, where the reporting is not always consistent, with some statistics being updated only every few days.

The reporting does include a field that is just `.killed` which is how many people were killed on a certain day and what I used in the first demo. The problem with this is that is does not distinguish between age, gender or professions, like medics or press. I implemented my function to have a more diverse visualisation, but I fear that the quality of the data is too low now.
If I switch back to `.killed` and `.injured`, I can maybe combine that with other datasets to get the variety I am looking for.
