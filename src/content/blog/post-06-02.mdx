Okay, today is an important day. I want to implement events on my timeline and I want to send my coach a test version of my jury presentation.

Let's start with events.

I'll start, where I always start, by creating a function:

```tsx

const drawEvents = () => {}
```

I'll need D3.js to draw the svg's and rects and I'll also need an update function to handle zooming.

The hard thing is to figure out the x and the width of the each event. I would like to incorporate the months as well, so that if you zoom in, you can see when exactly the event started.

```tsx
  const drawEvents = () => {
    d3.select(graphRef.current)
      .select("#group-timeline")
      .selectAll("svg.event")
      .data(events)
      .enter()
      .append("svg")
      .attr("class", "event")
      .attr(
        "x",
        (d) =>
          PADDING.left +
          (d.date.getFullYear() - timeline[0].year) * getTickWidth()
      )
      .attr("y", 0)
      .append("rect")
      .attr("class", "event-rect unzoom")
      .attr("y", HEIGHT_TIMELINE / 2 + PATH_PADDING)
      .attr(
        "x",
        (d) => 25 + ((d.date.getMonth() * getTickWidth()) / 12) * zoomLevel
      )
      .attr("height", getTickWidth())
      .attr("width", (d) => {
        return (
          (d.endDate.getFullYear() - d.date.getFullYear()) *
            getTickWidth() *
            zoomLevel -
          ((d.date.getMonth() * getTickWidth()) / 12) * zoomLevel +
          ((d.endDate.getMonth() * getTickWidth()) / 12) * zoomLevel
        );
      })
      .attr("rx", getTickWidth() / 2);
  };
```
One thing I am going to add is the support for events with a single date, and to give events were both dates in in the same year, the minimum width.

```tsx
  const getEventWidth = (d: DataEvent) => {
    if (d.endDate && d.endDate.getFullYear() !== d.date.getFullYear()) {
      return (
        (d.endDate.getFullYear() - d.date.getFullYear()) *
          getActualTickWidth() -
        (d.date.getMonth() * getActualTickWidth()) / 12 +
        (d.endDate.getMonth() * getActualTickWidth()) / 12
      );
    } else {
      return EVENT_MIN_WIDTH;
    }
  };
```

The rest of the day, I worked on the presentation for the jury, next week.
