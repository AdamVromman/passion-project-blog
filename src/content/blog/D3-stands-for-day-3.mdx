Today, I'm taking my first steps into actual research. The place where I want to start is **D3.js**. It's used for data visualisation more than for animation, but I think it's a good place to start because of that. I hope to get familiar with what basic data visualisation in code looks like, to then be able to move on the animating it with the other frameworks.
The idea is that I am going to make some demo's right here on the blog and see how each framework works and what they excel at or not.

I am going to start with the [get started](https://d3js.org/getting-started) of D3.js itself.
