Today I have something different to do. Since I want my end product to be a finished website, I need to think—at least a little—about the design. We are Devine, after all. So that is the goal for today. I already have the drawing from the other day, so I am just going to import this into Figma and start designing. I want to have a pretty clean design, with some *drawn*, *imperfect* inspirations. I got some inspiration from a video game called [The Long Dark](https://www.thelongdark.com/).

What is working for me right now is starting from the idea of the **Top Part Daily, Bottom Part Full Timeline**. By this I mean, that the first part of the website will be a daily update of what is happening in Gaza and the West Bank. My idea is still to have the data displayed in the form of an eye. The second part of the website is the full timeline of what is happening in Palestine. For that, I will have to gather data more manually, but this also allows me to easily combine multiple sources.

The first part could contain the following data, according to my research:

- killed in gaza
- injured in gaza
- killed in west bank
- injured in west bank
- children killed in west bank
- children injured in west bank
- destroyed buildings if possible

In the second part I could use the following data:

- settlers 1986 - 2021
- demolitions 2006 - 2024
- Palestinian refugees  2021 - 2023
- aggressions 2018 - 2024
- deaths 1948 - 2025
- named deaths 2014 - 2024
- events 1948 - 2025

The last part I leave open for now for the idea of the tapestry that I discussed earlier.

With the data clear, I started on a second version of the design, where I tried to incorporate the eye with the actual website.

I am probably going to do the rest of the design on the go, because I still want to focus mostly on the development. Things like fonts, colors and smaller things like margins, exact copy and things like that, will come later.
