So, it turns out that I didn't do my research properly in some areas. As I switched to the 3rd framework I wanted to try, I realized I had misinterpreted an article I read. The software, *Cavalry* is not actually meant to make web-based animations. In fact, it is a more traditional animation software, with .mp4 or .gif exports. 

After that, I also realized that *Rive*, the fourth software I wanted to try, is also different from what I thought. Although, it is possible to export animations so that they work in a web-based environment, it doesn't work with manipulating the DOM or SVGs or even a `<canvas>`. Apart from that, it is not coded in the same way as traditional coding and it has its own editor. 

This all sounds like it would make my project very different and stray away from programming a bit. Therefor I decided to refocus, first decide what I exactly I want to make and then choose either *GSAP* or *P5*, depending on my goals.
