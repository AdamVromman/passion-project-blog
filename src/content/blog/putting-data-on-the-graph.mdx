title: Putting Data on the Graph
description: After tinkering with the timeline, I'm going to start adding data to the graph.

Alright, so with a working, zoomable, panable graph, I am going to continue and put some actual data on it.

I created a new function called `createData()`. For now, I am going to work with just one datatype, being Adults Killed (per year).
The first thing I need are the max height for any datapoint in pixels and the highest datapoint in the dataset.

```tsx
    const maxHeight = getDimensions().height - HEIGHT_TIMELINE - PADDING.bottom;
    const maxKilled = d3.max(timeline, (d) => d.adultsKilled?.number ?? 0);
```

Next, I store a D3.js selection in a variable, so I don't have to do html lookups every time.

```tsx
    const data = svg.selectAll(".data").data(timeline);

    const groups = d3
      .select(graphRef.current)
      .select("#group-timeline")
      .selectAll("svg.tick");
```

Lastly, for every datapoint, I add a circle and give it some properties, some generic, some based on the data.

```tsx
groups
      .append("circle")
      .attr("id", (d) => `data-${d.year}`)
      .attr("cx", 25)
      .attr(
        "cy",
        (d) =>
          getDimensions().height -
          PADDING.bottom -
          ((d?.adultsKilled?.number ?? Math.random() * maxKilled) / maxKilled) *
            maxHeight
      )
      .attr("r", 5)
      .attr("class", "tick-data unzoom")
      .attr("fill", "red");
```

You might notice the `Math.random()`. I am just using this so that every year has a datapoint, even if I haven't filled in all the data yet.
Also important, is giving these circles the `unzoom` class, so they zoom doesn't distort them.

After calling the `createData()` function, this is the result:

It's definitely something! But it's a bit much and it seems to be lagging as well. Let's see if we can optimize.

I want to show only the dots whose years are also being shown and I want to have different, combinable, data types.

To do this, I first create a state that keeps track of the selected data types.

```tsx
  const [selectedData] = useState<SelectableDataType[]>([
    SelectableDataType.ADULTS_KILLED,
  ]);
```

Right now, it has AdultsKilled as a default.

Next up, when drawing the data, I give each circle a radius of 0. Since each tick has either 'decade', 'lustrum' or 'regular' in its class, I can easily create a function that changes the radius if the circle has to become visible, like this:

```tsx
const animateDataType = (timeline: boolean, parent: string, type: string) => {
    if (timeline) {
      gsapTimeline?.to(
        `.tick.${parent} .tick-data.${type}`,
        {
          attr: { r: 5 },
          duration: 0.2,
          ease: "bounce.out",
          stagger: 0.01,
        },
        "<"
      );
    } else {
      gsap.to(`.tick.${parent} .tick-data.${type}`, {
        attr: { r: 5 },
        duration: 0.2,
        ease: "bounce.out",
        stagger: 0.01,
      });
    }
  };
```

Once again, I tried to make it as generic as possible. Once again, it is possible to animate on a timeline or not. Secondly, the parent refers to it either being a decade, lustrum or regular tick. Lastly, the type refers to the data type, like AdultsKilled.

Since my selectedData contains all of the data types I have to show, I can create the following function and run it every time the data types change:

```tsx
    const animateData = (timeline: boolean, parent: string) => {
    selectedData.forEach((data) => {
      animateDataType(timeline, parent, data);
    });
  };
```

The outgoing effect is pretty cool, but I fear that I will have to do something about that later on.


But I am still only drawing data for AdultsKilled, so it's time to make `drawData()` more generic as well. 

```tsx
selectedData.forEach((data) => {
      console.log(data);
      groups
        .append("circle")
        .attr("id", (d: TimelineYear) => `data-${d.year}`)
        .attr("cx", 25)
        .attr(
          "cy",
          (d) =>
            getDimensions().height -
            PADDING.bottom -
            ((d[data]?.number ?? Math.random() * 1000) / 1000) * maxHeight
        )
        .attr("r", 0)
        .attr("class", `tick-data unzoom ${data}`);
    });
```

Luckily, this wasn't very hard. Just loop over each selected Data Type and draw a circle for each year and add the type to the class.

Lastly, I added css styling and buttons for each data type and added an `onMouseEnter()` and `onMouseLeave()` to easily visualize my project. I will definitely still changes this later on, but the result is very cool!
