From very early on, I knew that I wanted to make something about Palestine. The only problem was that I wasn't sure what. It has to involve data, be relevant to the current situation, be interactive and animated and hopefully, moving or meaningful. With my framework research in a weird place, I decided that the best way to move forward, is to make a decision on what exactly I was going to make. So let's look at some data from Gaza and the West Bank, which will definitely not be depressing as hell.

Most data sources agree that at least +40.000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7th, 2024 <Source APA='Counting the dead in Gaza: difficult but essential (2024). Khatib, Rasha et al. The Lancet, Volume 404, Issue 10449, 237 - 238' link='https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext' name='Khatib' year={2024} />, but this number in itself does not seem to be enough for a lot of people, since it has been shared and updated for more than a year now.

There is also this list of names of people killed. This video already does a better job at conveying the horrors and getting people to care about the victims. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poHGZW-mg_M) is an hour long and list all the names of the people, known to have been killed. It is a mind-numbing and horrifying video that should be watched by everyone.

<div class="flex flex-row gap-8">

My first idea is to work with these names. Like for example, assign a long triangle or rectangle to each name and place them in a circle, so they create the shape of an iris. Each date a different name is in the center and people can leave comments under the name, in an attempt the move away from abstract numbers and towards actual individuals. This concept of one name per day would take more than 100 years to complete, if no other names where added to the list ever.

Another idea I am thinking about is to use the so-important olive trees of Gaza. Olive trees are culturally and economically very significant to the Palestinian people. There used to be more than 2 million of them in Gaza alone, but that number has fallen to less than 380.000 in the last year. The idea that the trees have deep roots in the land, same as the Palestinians is an idea that speaks to me.

The *keffiyeh*, traditional headwear from Palestine <Source APA='Renfro, E. (2017). Stitched together, torn apart: The keffiyeh as cultural guide. International Journal of Cultural Studies, 21(6), 571â€“586. https://doi.org/10.1177/1367877917713266' name='Renfro' year={2017} link='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1367877917713266' />, also comes to mind. It is very recognizable and it is not hard to imagine it in as a mathematical pattern. It could represent the remaining hospitals, schools, homes, etc. in Gaza and then it would look like it's unraveling. The leaves actually represent the olive trees, the grid represent the fishing net and the lines represent the historic trading routes crossing Palestine.

Lastly, I am thinking of an interactive timeline, where you can drag things on it to see its evolution over time. For example, drag a hospital icon onto the timeline to see how hospitals are being destroyed throughout the years. Or you could drag the icon of a car on it and see how the roads have deteriorated or how free access to Palestine has changed over the years.

Right now, I am looking through a lot of datasets, databases, websites and documents to determine what data I am going to use and from where I'll get it.

1. [Tech For Palestine](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/killed-in-gaza/). This is a list of people killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, which also states ages and gender, but it has not been updated since September 2024, so the data is not complete.
2. [Central Agency for Palestinian Statistics](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/site/lang__ar/1408/Default.aspx). This site offers a lot of different statistics like destruction of infrastructure and hurt or killed people, but the dat is not easily accessible.
3. [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/group/pse). This site offer a lot of data, in many different areas and in many different formats. The challenge here would be to combine it all together.
4. [UNOSAT](https://gaza-unosat.hub.arcgis.com/pages/data). Here I found location data for destroyed buildings and infrastructure. I am not sure yet how I can use it, but I keep it in mind.
