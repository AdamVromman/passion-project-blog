The thing that speaks the most to me right now was using the *keffiyeh* pattern to convey data. I am going to start out with GSAP for now, but I do feel that there might be a chance that P5 might be better for this. I will see how it goes.

Okay, so what I am looking for is an animation that builds up the *keffiyeh* while a user scrolls. Right now, I am using a GSAP Timeline and Scrolltrigger. I am thinking that a sort of knitting pattern could be cool, so that is where I am starting.

The first thing I want to look at is the simple black bars that run across the pattern. They are grey-ish black and when they overlap, they darken, as if they had a 0.5 opacity. That should be doable to recreate.


I am starting with 2.000 small 2x10 pixels rectangles that criss-cross to form that pattern. I am thinking that after the initial animation, I could overlap the pattern with a simple black rectangle, after which I can delete the already animated rectangles. That way, I don't strain my resources too much from the beginning.

```tsx
    const data = new Array(2000).fill(0);
    const squares = d3
        .select(movingSvgRef.current)
        .selectAll("rect")
        .data(data)
        .enter()
        .append("rect")
        .attr("width", 10)
        .attr("height", 2)
        .attr("x", (_, i) => (i % 3) * 10 * i)
        .attr("y", (_, i) => (i % 3 <= 1 ? 0 : 26))
        .attr("fill", "black");
```

Right now, it seems a bit obsolete to use D3 for this, but this does make it easier to generate this with data later on. I am also trying to generate the upper and lower thin band at the same time, since they are the same animation. That is why the x and y values are being calculated that way. Basically, since they work in pairs, every third and fourth rectangle is 26 pixels lower.

import DemoPattern from '../../components/Topic/DemoPattern.tsx'

<DemoPattern client:only="react"/>
</Demo>

For now, I am going to leave it at that and move on. I think the Keffiyeh pattern is a really great idea, but I am not sure if GSAP is the right technology for it. I am going to see how to use GSAP effectively and how to generate the pattern.
