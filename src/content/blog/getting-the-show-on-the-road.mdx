Here we are. The official start of the last project of Devine, discounting my internship. I am ready to make it something special, starting with my topic.
My research question is as follows:

### How can we use web-based animation frameworks to help visualise data in meaningful ways?

I'll go over each part of this question and explain what it means for me.

1. When I say web-based animation frameworks, I am talking about libraries like **D3.js**, **Cavalry** and **GSAP**. I want to research and compare these and see how each one can be used to visualise (large amounts of) data.
2. Data visualisation for me means to take a lot of points of data and crafting a story or narrative out of it. Sometimes these individual points don't mean much on their own and sometimes they are deeply intimate and personal. I am interested in both.
3. Lastly, I need it to be meaningful. By this, I mean that it needs to be valuable for a cause that I believe in. Data visualisation can be a strong tool and can be used to misrepresent data in significant ways. I, of course, want to avoid that.

The project will consist of three parts:

1. Researching the animation frameworks.
2. choosing a specific framework and do in-depth data visualisation testing with it.
3. Create a demo site about a specific topic.

As you can see, in the last step, I will create a demo site using all of the things that I learned. The topic of this site will be **the ongoing genocide in Gaza** and **the occupation of Palestinian land**. This is a serious and deeply political topic, which is something we are not used to work with in Devine, but I want my last project at Devine to reflect the things that are important to me.

I acknowledge that this is not an easy topic to work with and there is a lot of misinformation and controversy surrounding it. Therefore, I want to start by presenting some facts and resources about the topic.

1. Israel illegally occupies Palestinian (and neigbouring countries') territories. <Source name="Ronen" year="2008" APA="Ronen, Y. (2008). Illegal occupation and its consequences. Israel Law Review, 41(1–2), 201–245. https://doi.org/10.1017/s0021223700000224" link="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0021223700000224" />
2. In 1948, Israel forced 750.000 Palestinians to flee their homes in a campaign later known as *the Nakba* (The catastrophe). <Source name="Natour" year={2015} APA="Natour, G. (2015). The Nakba—Flight and expulsion of the Palestinians in 1948. In Springer eBooks (pp. 81–104). https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20846-6_5" link="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20846-6_5" />
3. Israel has committed three acts of genocide with the requisite intent. <Source name='Albanese' year="2024" APA="Albanese, F. (2024). Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session55/advance-versions/a-hrc-55-73-auv.pdf" link='https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session55/advance-versions/a-hrc-55-73-auv.pdf' />

With this addressed, I am going to move on the technical side of the project.

The frameworks that I want to research are the following:

1. **GSAP**
2. **Framer Motion**
3. **Cavalry**
4. **Rive**

But before I start with these four, I want to read up about **D3.js**, which is a data visualisation library. I want to check if it has built in animation capabilities and if not, whether it can be used with any of the aforementioned libraries.

Apart from that, I need to give myself, and you, an idea of what exactly I am imaginging when I say animated data visualisation. A good reference is the work of Italian artist [Federica Fragapane](https://www.behance.net/FedericaFragapane), but then animated. The following images are works of her that I find particularly interesting:

<div class="flex flex-row gap-4">

</div>

[Here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/207824389/Gaza), she visualises the rapidly increasing population density in the city of Rafah, due to the amount of people fleeing.

![Data viz showing the title 'how Europeans think and feel about immigration' and a bunch of small hills and dots above the hills. No further context](/getting-the-show-on-the-road/hearts-and-minds.png)

[This one](https://www.behance.net/gallery/133409063/Hearts-and-minds) is the cover art of a study about how Europeans feel about immigration.

While I am looking over Fragapane's work, I noticed that she has [two courses](https://www.domestika.org/en/federica_fragapane) on data visualisation. This is great news and I will definitely check them out!

Before I start with my *D3.js* research, I want to summarise a planning that I can then copy to the timeline on the homepage.
