Okay! Finally time to move on to the *actual* animation libraries. First on the line is GSAP, because I am already familiar with it. For all of the libraries, I am going to try and animate the same things, to see how it works and how they hold up when, for example, I want to animate a few thousand points.

For data, we are going to use a 10.000-entry .csv file called organisations.

But let's start with a simple square performing a circular movement. For the sake of exercise, I will try and intergrate D3 into these demo's as well.
