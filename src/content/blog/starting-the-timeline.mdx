I am immediatly going against my title, because I am not actually starting with the timeline just yet. I want to develop the eye a bit more, before I move on. My plan is not to finish it today, but to have it done in a broad sense. For now, the eye only displays the people killed in Gaza on a certain day. I want to add to that the people that were injured in Gaza and the people that were killed and injured in the West Bank. 

I also have two `setTimeout()`'s that I want to convert into one. Basically, I need a small timeout to make sure that the animation of the eye opening and closing can actually happen and secondly I need a small timeout for all the parts of the iris to be generated, before I start animating them. If the animation starts too soon, the elements don't exist yet and GSAP complains.
